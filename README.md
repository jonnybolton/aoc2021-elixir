# Advent of Code 2021: Elixir
I am using [2021's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenge as an exercise to learn the [Elixir programming language](https://elixir-lang.org).
I am not aiming to write fast, production-ready code.
I am instead aiming to write idiomatic Elixir code, making use of the different tools available in the language, i.e. [processes](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/processes.html), [comprehensions](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/comprehensions.html), etc..

## Prerequisites
- Elixir - Installation instructions can be found at: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html

## Running
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root of the project
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jonnybolton/aoc2021-elixir.git
   cd aoc2021-elixir
   ```
2. Download the puzzle input files from the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2021). You will be required to create an account if you do not have one.
3. Run the code for a particular day like so
   ```
   elixir lib/day01.exs day01.txt
   ```
   replacing the path to the input file with your own input location.
